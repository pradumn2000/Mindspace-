*Project Title:* MindSpace - A Mental Health Tracker and Support Platform

 Project Overview:
MindSpace is a web application that allows users to track their mental health, access mental wellness resources, and engage with an anonymous community for support. It includes features for mood tracking, journaling, connecting with licensed therapists, and accessing educational content related to mental well-being
Features:

   - Users can register and log in using JWT authentication. Passwords are securely hashed.

2. *Mood Tracker:*
   - *Frontend:* React
   - *Backend:* Node.js, Express, MongoDB
   - Users can log their daily mood using simple emojis or a scale system (1-10). The data is stored in MongoDB and visualized with charts (like a line graph to show trends over time).

3. *Journal/Diary Section:*
   - Users can write journal entries about their day, thoughts, or feelings. This will be stored in a MongoDB database, and they can access their past entries.
   - Add features like searching through past journal entries using keywords or filtering by date.
   - *React Rich Text Editor*: To make journaling more interactive.

4. *Anonymous Community Support Forum:*
   - *Frontend:* React
   - *Backend:* Node.js, Express, MongoDB
   - A community forum where users can post anonymously about their challenges, ask questions, or give advice. Other users can comment and provide support.
   - Posts and comments will be stored in MongoDB, with user profiles being anonymized.

5. *Therapist/Support Directory:*
   - A section where users can view a list of available therapists or mental health professionals.
   - Integration with email or calendar for booking sessions with therapists. (Optional).

6. *Educational Resources:*
   - A blog or resource section where users can read articles, watch videos, and learn about mental health-related topics.
   - Articles stored in MongoDB, with categories like Anxiety, Depression, Mindfulness, etc.

7. *Progress Dashboard:*
   - Users can visualize their mental health journey using charts (mood trends, number of journal entries, forum activity).
   - *Technologies:* Chart.js or D3.js (for data visualization in React).

8. *Admin Panel (Optional):*
   - A simple admin dashboard for content moderation (e.g., removing inappropriate forum posts).
   - CRUD operations for educational articles, user management, etc.

### Stack:
- *Frontend:* React (with Redux or Context API for state management)
- *Backend:* Node.js, Express
- *Database:* MongoDB
- *Authentication:* JWT
- *Data Visualization:* Chart.js / D3.js for mood tracking and dashboard

### Extensions:
